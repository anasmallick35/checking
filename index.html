<!-- 1. we use here npm for reloading the site using terminal "live-server"
     2. we istall "lodash" which is the extension for js which has many js functions
    3. if we have to install for globally means for whole computer then we use "-g" with isntall like: "npm install -g live-server" other wise we dont use "-g" if we want only for specific folder
     4. for using lodash we first assign in js file as mention in fisrt line of js then we replace the name of js file to bundle.js by writing in terminal like: "browserify script.js > bundle.js"
    5. for updating things always and type "browserify script.js > bundle.js" we have to do short so for that we change the "test" in json file to "browserify script.js > bundle.js" and every time when we type npm run test it done the same thing. Check out the example in json file-->
